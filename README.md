## 3d physics engine ##


Oimo.js is a new 3d physics engine in javascript.

It is a conversion of [OimoPhysics](https://github.com/saharan/OimoPhysics) created by Saharan for flash. I use [jangaroo](http://www.jangaroo.net/home/) for this conversion. Because I wanted a light and fast physics engine for use with three.js. The result is not bad for 130 kb.

----------

Here are some demos with three.js
